<p>Hello! I am Tanish Patel and currently I am a 14 year old freshman in high school here to give tips on school and other special skills of mine.
You may be asking what makes me qualified to give such life advice.
Well I was Salutatorian of my middle school, I have a 4.0 GPA, and I currently attend a Magnet High School that focuses on Science and Technology and is nationally ranked.I also excel there and have been placed in Pre-calculus for my Freshman year. Not only that but I am also a class Senator meaning I have a strong leadership background as well. 
 Aside from academics I am also a developer or at least in the learning stages. I have a quite diverse understanding of the languages as I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++ and Java. 
 As for projects I have done with these languages I have made at this point two websites including this one utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As for Python I have created AI models as part of a program called Inspirit AI and I plan to learn more about that. 
 In C++ I am currently learning the Raylib library for game development. Finally, in Java I am learning to program in WPILib for robotics as I am part of my school's FRC team 1257(The Snails).
Go snails! If you would like to support our team please donate on the website here: <a href="https://frc1257.org/">FRC 1257</a> Other interests of mine include developing new inventions with Fusion 360 which I am still learning as well as learning business skills like Excel and investing. Other softwares I take interest in are Adobe Photoshop and XS for design, although I still have not started learning that. As for clubs and extracurriculars I am a part of FBLA, Technology Student Association, Multicultural Club, Science Club, SkillsUSA, Coding club along with many others.
I am also working towards an AWS Certification. Stay tuned on <a href="BlogPosts.html">my blog</a> for that! </p>
