        <p>Hello! This is my blog page which I will regularly update with new post about my learning journey in coding, school tips, and other special skills of mine. Stay tuned for new posts!<br>

               January 2025: In Eighth Grade I participated in a STEM competition in Fiserv called Future Fintechies where we learned fintech concepts such as cybersecurity, AI and other financial technologies. We created a project to present to judges and I learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration as well as some new skills in presentation and research. <br>

                June 18, 2025: At Eighth Grade graduation I was awarded as the Salutatorian of my class. As you can see in the About Me page I gave a whole speech to start off the ceremony. <br>

              October 2024: I have won first place in Eighth grade in a Rangoli competition. Rangoli is essentially a type of art usually done with sand that has a religious significance. The specific design I chose required precision but it was quite rewarding I think. The swastik in the middle represents auspiciousness in my culture and the beauty of it is to honor god. <br>

            October 2025: Here I have won second place in a Rangoli competition in Ninth grade. This time I got moved up to the higher group with more advanced kids and my design although it was quite good was still lacking compared to another sand design which had much more skill than mine. <br>

            July 2025: I have created AI models as part of a program called Inspirit AI. In this STEM program during the summer we learned not only the mechanics and some of the high-level math behind AI, but also the python and libraries used to create it. We created a project and slideshow to innovate and create our own models that had real applications in the world. The specific model we created for the presentation was a distracted driving detector. Other models we created include an exoplanet detector, NLP for stock sentiment analysis, Cancer detection and some others across 8 days. The workshop helped spark my interest in AI and it has led to me creating one of my own personal models which is still under development. <br>

            October 2025:Here I am learning the Raylib library for game development in C++. Because I am already proficient at object-oriented programming in C++ after completing the codecademy course it was the obvious next step to apply my learning to a library. I chose raylib because it is a simple library that fulfills the needs of a game I have in mind for creating. I will also submit this game as an entry for my TSA competition. <br>

            November 2025: I am learning to program in WPILib for robotics as I am part of my school's FRC team 1257(The Snails). The specific programming library that is used in FRC is WPILib which was programmed and created by Worchester Polytechnic Institute. Motors that are used in the build of the robot are NEO Motors because of their preciseness and most importantly price. Teams that are better at fundraising use the more expensive Kraken motors. As a member of an FRC team it is important to fundraise and it is important for companies to help out with that. Your company can too, check out the <a href="https://frc1257.org/">website</a> and contact me if your company wants to sponsor.<br>
